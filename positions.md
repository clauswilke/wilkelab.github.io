<a id="postdocs"></a>
The majority of our work in the lab is computational, but many of the ongoing projects provide ample opportunity to interact with experimental groups.  We are generally looking for candidates with a background or strong interest in computational biology, systems biology, biochemistry, data science, theoretical physics, or computer science. Applicants with knowledge of R and/or python and with experience in high-performance computing environments are preferred.

**Postdocs.**
There are no open positions currently, but qualified candidates are encouraged to contact Claus Wilke and inquire about potential opportunities.

**Graduate students.**
Prospective graduate students should inquire with Claus Wilke, but will have to apply through the regular process at UT Austin, either with the [Interdisciplinary Life Sciences (ILS) Graduate Program](https://ils.utexas.edu/) or the [Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior (EEB) Graduate Program.](http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/graduate/eeb/) The majority of students in the lab have historically come through the ILS program.

**Undergraduates.**
Undergraduates usually work for course credit or volunteer. Please contact Claus Wilke and inquire about current opportunities.
